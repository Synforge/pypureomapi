Description: ISC DHCP OMAPI protocol implementation in Python
 This module grew out of frustration about pyomapi and later pyomapic. The
 extension modules mentioned can be used to query the ISC DHCP server for
 information about leases. pyomapic does this job using swig and the static
 library provided with ISC DHCP. It leaks and has basically no error checking.
 Adding error checking later turned out to be a maintenance hell with swig, so
 a pure Python implementation for omapi, pypureomapi was born. It can mostly
 be used as a drop-in replacement for pyomapic.
